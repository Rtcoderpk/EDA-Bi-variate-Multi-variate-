# EDA-Bi-variate-Multi-variate
Purpose of Bi-variate EDA

Bi-variate EDA is used to analyze the relationship between two variables.

           1) Understanding Relationships:

Identify and quantify the relationship between two variables, such as correlation and dependency.
Determine if changes in one variable are associated with changes in another.

           2) Detecting Patterns:

Detect patterns and trends that can suggest potential causality or co-occurrence.

           3) Hypothesis Testing:

Test hypotheses about the relationship between two variables (e.g., does variable X influence variable Y?).

           4)Feature Engineering:

Identify useful combinations of variables that can be engineered into new features for machine learning models.




Purpose of Multi-variate EDA

Multi-variate EDA extends the analysis to three or more variables.

           1) Understanding Complex Relationships:

Explore how multiple variables interact with each other.
Understand the joint influence of multiple variables on a target variable.

           2) Dimensionality Reduction:

Identify and reduce redundant features, focusing on the most significant variables for modeling.

           3) Feature Selection:

Select the most relevant features for predictive modeling.

           4) Detecting Interactions:

Detect interactions between variables that might not be apparent in bi-variate analysis.
